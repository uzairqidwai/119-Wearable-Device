# Issues Faced
- Our USB-to-TTL converter was not able to interface over serial with the A9G module. We ran through various troubleshooting steps, and managed to figure out the issue was due to an incompatibility between the CP210 chip and the hardware serial pins on the A9G. We resolved this by using an FT232-based USB-to-TTL converter instead and were able to successfully communicate with the A9G!
- We were not able to get the T-Display-S3 microcontroller to communicate with the A9G over the serial pins. We tried many troubleshooting steps, including a man-in-the-middle serial connection to verify commands were being sent and received. With this test, we discovered that the A9G was not able to "understand" the commands being sent to it by the T-Display-S3 microcontroller. We believe that this was again, due to an incompatibility between the hardware serial pins on the A9G and the T-Display-S3. We resolved this by configuring softwareSerial to run on different pins than the hardware pins and were able to successfully have bi-directional communication between the A9G and T-Display-S3.
- We had random characters being added to messages that were being sent between the A9G and T-Display-S3 when they were communicating over serial. We discovered that this was due to a limitation of softwareSerial not being able to keep up with the high default baud rate of the A9G of 115200. We resolved this by updating the firmware of the A9G to use a baud rate of 9600 by default, and then updated our script on the T-Display-S3 to match. 
- The battery was not working when we plugged it into the S3 module. Through debugging, we realized that for the S3 to receive power via the battery connector and not the USB, we would have to configure those pins in the sketch we upload to the microcontroller.
